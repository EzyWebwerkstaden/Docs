### Html
We usally use bootstrap3 html. That's are current standard.

### Css
We try to use .less for all css coding here on ezy. So if you need to change an legacy project.
You should add a new .less file with the same name and copy the .css file to that. So we can start getting .less in.

Also we should always avoid in-line css and use css files for all CSS.

#### Naming

#### Capitalizing
We will always name our classes with lowercase.

for example:
`#my-button { ... }` 

#### Semantic naming

We should name our classes on what they do and not a color or what css it contains. For example  
 `.confirm-button` is fine , but not `.blue-button`
